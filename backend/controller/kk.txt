Dear Radio ijwi rya Gare,

I hope this letter finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I represent Mtandao Ltd, a leading company specializing in innovative software solutions. I am writing to explore the possibility of a strategic partnership between Mtandao Ltd and Radio ijwi rya Gare to address a shared challenge - the increasing incidents of lost belongings in public places.

Having observed Radio ijwi rya Gare's commendable efforts in providing vital information to the public, we believe that our respective entities can collaborate effectively to enhance the Lost and Found services available at bus stations.

Mtandao Ltd has developed a state-of-the-art Lost and Found software that streamlines the process of recovering lost items. Our platform empowers administrators to efficiently log found items, and individuals who have lost their belongings can easily claim and retrieve them. By partnering with Radio ijwi rya Gare, we can extend the reach of this system to a broader audience, ensuring that accurate information about lost items is broadcasted effectively.

Proposed Partnership Structure:

We suggest a mutually beneficial partnership arrangement, as follows:

Radio ijwi rya Gare assists in broadcasting announcements about found items through its platform to reach a wider audience at bus stations.

When a found item is logged into the system, the necessary details will be provided to Radio ijwi rya Gare for timely broadcasting.

A service fee will be charged to individuals claiming their lost belongings. The distribution of this fee is as follows:

30% of the service fee will be retained by Mtandao Ltd for providing and maintaining the Lost and Found software platform.

70% of the service fee will be allocated to Radio ijwi rya Gare for its efforts in broadcasting the Lost and Found announcements and helping reunite individuals with their belongings.

By establishing this partnership, we believe that Radio ijwi rya Gare will contribute significantly to enhancing the Lost and Found services at bus stations and play a vital role in reuniting lost items with their rightful owners.

We would be delighted to meet with you to discuss the finer details of this partnership and explore how we can jointly work towards creating a more efficient and reliable Lost and Found system for the benefit of the community.

Thank you for considering this proposal. Please feel free to contact me at [Your Email Address] or [Your Phone Number] to arrange a meeting or if you have any questions.

Looking forward to the possibility of collaborating with Radio ijwi rya Gare.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
